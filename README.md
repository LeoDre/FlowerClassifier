# FlowerClassifier

The purpose of this project is to build a neural network that can recognize different species of flowers using pytorch.

__WARNING__:This is a project from Udacity's " [AI Programming with Python Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-programming-python-nanodegree--nd089)". I hope my code can help you with your project (if you are working on the same project as this one) but please do not copy my code and please follow [Udacity Honor Code](https://www.udacity.com/legal/community-guidelines) when you are doing your project.

## Project Description
This project has 2 parts:
1. Implement and test the classifier in Jupyter Notebook

2. Convert the trained and tested classifier to a command line application
